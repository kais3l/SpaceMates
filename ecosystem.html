            <h3 class="desc">An ecosystem is a community of living things, like plants, animals, and microorganisms, interacting with each other and their environment (like air, water, and soil). Ecosystems can be as large as a forest or as small as a pond.

            <h2>How Ecosystems Affect Air Quality</h2>
            <br><br>
            
            <h3>1.Plants Clean the Air:</h3>
            <br><br>

            <p>Absorbing Pollutants: Plants and trees absorb carbon dioxide (CO₂) </p>
            <p>and other pollutants, helping to keep the air clean.</p>
            
            <br><br><br>
            <h3>2.Pollution Impact</h3>
            <br><br><br>
            <p> Harmed Ecosystems: When ecosystems are damaged, </p>
            <p>like during deforestation, there are fewer plants to clean the air, leading to poorer air quality.

            </p>

            <br><br><br>
            <br><br><br>

            <h2>How Ecosystems Affect Climate Change</h2>
            <br><br><br>
            <br><br><br>
            <h3>1.Carbon Absorption:</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>CO₂ Storage: Forests, wetlands, and oceans absorb carbon dioxide from the air,</p><p> which helps reduce the impact of climate change.
            </p>
            <br><br>

            <h3>2.Ecosystem Loss:</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p> Fewer Natural Absorbers: When ecosystems are destroyed by things like deforestation </p><p>or wildfires, less CO₂ is absorbed, which speeds up climate change. </p>
            <br><br>
           

            <h2> How Ecosystems Affect Wildfires</h2>
            <br><br><br>
            <br><br><br>
            <h3>1.Fuel for Fires:</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>- Dry Vegetation: In dry ecosystems, like grasslands or forests, </p><p>plants can become fuel for wildfires, making them spread faster.
            </p>
            <br><br>

            <h3>2.Ecosystem Recovery:</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p> - Slow Regrowth: After a wildfire, it can take years for the ecosystem to regrow</p><p> and return to balance, affecting plants, animals, and their habitat.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h2> How Ecosystems Affect Droughts</h2>
            <br><br><br>
            <br><br><br>
            <h3>1.Water Cycle Regulation:</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p> - Plants Keep Water in the Soil: Healthy ecosystems </p><p>help store water in the soil, which can prevent droughts from getting worse.

            </p>
            <br><br>

            <h3>2.Loss of Vegetation:</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>    - Worsened Droughts: When ecosystems are damaged by </p><p>deforestation or fires, there are fewer plants to retain water, making droughts worse.

            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Interconnectedness of Ecosystems, Air Quality, </p><p>Climate Change, Wildfires, and Drought</h2>
            <br><br><br>
            <br><br><br>
            <h3>1.Ecosystems and Air Quality:</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p> - Plants clean the air, but damaged ecosystems </p><p>lead to more pollution and worse air quality.</p>
            <br><br>

            <h3>2.Ecosystems and Climate Change:</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>     - Healthy ecosystems absorb CO₂ and help slow climate change,</p><p> but when they are harmed, they release more carbon into the atmosphere.
